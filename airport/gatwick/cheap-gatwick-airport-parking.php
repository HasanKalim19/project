								<h2 class="airport-content-head2">What happened to Terminal 1?</h2>
								<p>You might be wondering why Heathrow Airport’s four terminals are numbered 2 to 5. That’s because Terminal 1 was closed to the public in 2015 as the airlines operating from it moved to the airport’s bigger and better terminals. Whilst it is still there, Terminal 1 is scheduled to be demolished in order to make way for a major expansion of Terminal 2.</p>
								<br/>
								 
								<h2 class="airport-content-head2">How do I get to Heathrow Airport?</h2>

								<br/>
								 
								<h2 class="airport-content-head2">How do I get between terminals?</h2>
